				<h2>Parrot</h2>
				<p>Parrots, also known as psittacines are birds of the 
				roughly 393 species in 92 genera comprising the order Psittaciformes,
				found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The order is subdivided 
				into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true" parrots), the 
				Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea . 
				One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with higher 
			aggregate extinction risk than any other comparable bird group.</p>

				<h2>Pigeon</h2>
				<p>The domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) is a pigeon subspecies that was derived from the rock dove (also called the rock pigeon). The rock pigeon is the world's oldest domesticated bird. Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do Egyptian hieroglyphics.[2] Research suggests that domestication of pigeons occurred as early as 10,000 years ago.</p>

				<p>Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl as peahens, though peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks".</p>
